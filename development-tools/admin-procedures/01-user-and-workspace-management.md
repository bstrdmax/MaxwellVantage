### 1. Accessing Settings

-   **Action**: Click the **"Settings"** icon in the bottom-left of the sidebar.
-   **Result**: You will be taken to the Settings page, which contains all administrative controls.

### 2. Managing Team Members

-   **Location**: Account & Workspace > Team Members card.

#### Inviting a New User

1.  Click the **"Invite Member"** button.
2.  (Mock) A modal will appear asking for the new user's email address and role (e.g., Member, Admin).
3.  Enter the required information and click **"Send Invitation"**.
4.  The invited user will receive an email with instructions to join the workspace. They will appear in the team list with a "Pending" status until they accept.

#### Removing a User

1.  (Mock) Hover over the user you wish to remove in the team list.
2.  A "Remove" or trash can icon will appear. Click it.
3.  A confirmation dialog will appear. Confirm the action to remove the user from the workspace.

### 3. Modifying Workspace Settings

-   **Location**: Account & Workspace > Workspace Settings card.

#### Changing the Workspace Name

1.  Locate the **"Workspace Name"** input field.
2.  Modify the text in the field.
3.  (Mock) The change is saved automatically upon clicking outside the input field.

### 4. Updating Profile Information

-   **Location**: Account & Workspace > My Profile card.
-   **Procedure**: User profile information such as Name and Email is typically synced from the identity provider and is not editable directly within the application. This is reflected by the disabled input fields. To change this information, the user would need to do so in the master account system (e.g., their Google account).
