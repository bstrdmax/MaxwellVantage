# Guide: Prospect Intelligence Hub

The Prospect Intelligence Hub is your AI-powered assistant for discovering, analyzing, and strategizing your sales outreach.

## 1. System Context

This is the "brain" of the prospecting AI. It's crucial to keep this information up-to-date and aligned with your business goals. The AI uses this context for every task it performs.

-   **Ideal Client Persona**: Describe your perfect customer in detail.
-   **Mission & Values**: Explain what your company stands for.
-   **Sales Strategy**: Outline your approach to sales (e.g., consultative, product-led).

## 2. AI Prospector

This tool allows you to actively find new leads.

-   **Manual Query**: Enter a descriptive query about the type of prospect you're looking for. Be specific! For example, "B2B SaaS companies in the fintech sector that just raised a Series A round."
-   **Get Suggestion**: If you're unsure where to start, click this button. The AI will analyze your **System Context** and suggest a high-potential area to search.
-   **Find New Prospects**: After entering a query, click this button. The AI will search (simulated) for prospects matching your criteria and add them to the top of your Prospect List.

## 3. Prospect List & Analysis View

-   **Prospect List**: This is your pipeline of potential clients. Click on any prospect to view their details.
-   **Analysis View**: When you select a prospect, this panel shows their detailed information.
    -   **Sync to Airtable**: If a prospect looks promising, click this button to add them to your official records.

        -   **Conversion Strategy**: An actionable plan to engage the prospect.
