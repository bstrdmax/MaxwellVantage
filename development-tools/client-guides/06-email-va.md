# Guide: Email Virtual Assistant

The Email VA is designed to reduce the time you spend in your inbox by summarizing emails and drafting intelligent responses.

## 1. Morning & Afternoon Digests

The view is organized into batches, simulating how an assistant would present emails for review at set times.
-   **Morning Digest**: Typically includes overnight emails and sets the priorities for the day.
-   **Afternoon Digest**: Helps clear the inbox before the end of the day.

Switch between digests using the buttons at the top.

## 2. Digest Summary

This card gives you a high-level overview of the current batch of emails.
-   **Metrics**: Shows the total number of emails processed and how many require a response.
-   **Key Insights**: The AI reads through all emails and extracts the most important information, such as urgent requests, meeting proposals, or key themes. This allows you to understand the state of your inbox without reading every single email.

## 3. Review Queue & Suggested Response

-   **Review Queue**: A list of emails that require your attention. Click on any email to select it.
-   **Suggested Response**: When you select an email, the AI will automatically draft a response based on the email's content and its understanding of your business.
    -   The response is fully editable in the text area.
    -   **Action Buttons**:
        -   **Send**: (Simulates) Sends the email as-is.
        -   **Edit**: (UI element) Acknowledges you might want to change it.
        -   **Archive**: (Simulates) Moves the email out of your inbox without a reply.
