# Guide: Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard is your at-a-glance command center. It provides a high-level summary of your business's most critical metrics and activities.

## Key Components

### 1. Stat Cards

Located at the top, these cards provide a quick snapshot of key performance indicators (KPIs):
-   **Active Projects**: Total number of projects not marked as "Completed".
-   **Projects at Risk**: The count of projects with "At Risk" or "Off Track" status.
-   **Avg. Project Health**: The average health score across all active projects.
-   **New Prospects**: The number of new leads added to your pipeline.

Each card includes a trend indicator to show performance over time.

### 2. Revenue Forecasting Chart

This interactive line chart visualizes your forecasted revenue versus your actual revenue, helping you track financial performance against goals. You can hover over points on the chart to see specific monthly data.

### 3. Project Health

This section lists your top projects and their current health scores, represented by a percentage and a progress bar. The color of the bar indicates the project's status:
-   **Green**: On Track (>= 85%)
-   **Yellow**: At Risk (60-84%)
-   **Red**: Off Track (< 60%)

### 4. Recent Activity Feed

This feed provides a real-time log of important events happening across the system, such as:
-   A new prospect being added.
-   A project's status changing.
-   An automated action being completed (e.g., contract generation).

The color-coded border indicates the type of activity (Success, Alert, or Info).

### 5. Client Intelligence Quickview

This card provides a summary of lead generation activities and a direct link to the **Prospects Assistant** for deeper analysis.
