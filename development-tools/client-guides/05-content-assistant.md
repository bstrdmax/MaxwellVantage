# Guide: Content Workspace

The Content Workspace is your integrated solution for content strategy, ideation, and AI-powered creation.

## 1. Content Calendar

This provides a visual overview of your content schedule.
-   Navigate between months using the arrow buttons.
-   Existing content pieces are displayed on their publish dates.
-   Click on a content item to see a quick view of its details, including title, type, and status.

## 2. Content Creation Assistant

This is where you turn ideas into published content.

### Ideas & Generation
-   **Recent Content Ideas**: This list shows ideas captured from various sources. Click an idea to load it into the generator.
-   **Ideas from Google Drive**: The system can detect potential content ideas from documents in your connected Drive. Click "Import & Generate" to use one.
-   **Generate from Topic**: Manually type or paste a topic into the text area.
-   Click **"Generate Content"**. The AI will use your topic and the **AI Content Brain** to draft multiple content formats (Blog Post, Social Media, etc.).

### AI Content Brain
Similar to the Prospects Assistant, this section configures the AI's "personality" for content creation.
-   **Writing Voice & Tone**: Define the style you want (e.g., "Professional yet witty," "Technical and authoritative").
-   **Specific Guidance**: Provide rules for the AI to follow (e.g., "Always start with a customer pain point," "End every blog post with a question").
-   **Recent Work Examples**: Add snippets of your best content. The AI uses these as a gold standard to match its output.

## 3. Generated Content & Workflow

Once content is generated, it appears in the "Generated Content" section. Each piece is a card with several actions:

1.  **Status**: Starts as `Draft`.
2.  **Send to Drive**: Moves the content to a `In Drive` status and (simulates) saves the text to a new file in your connected Google Drive.
3.  **Approve**: Marks the content as `Approved` and `Synced` to Airtable, ready for scheduling.
4.  **Edit**: (UI element) Allows for manual changes.
5.  **Discard**: Deletes the generated content piece.
