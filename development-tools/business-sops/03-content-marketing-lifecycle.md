# SOP: Content Marketing Lifecycle

**Objective:** To streamline the content creation process from initial idea to final publication using an AI-assisted workflow.

**Primary Tool:** Maxwell Vantage - Content Workspace

---

### Phase 1: Ideation & Input

-   **Action**: The content strategist captures content ideas from various sources.
-   **Methods**:
    1.  **Automated**: The system automatically scans connected Google Drive documents and surfaces potential ideas in the **"Ideas from Google Drive"** card.
    2.  **Manual**: The strategist can add a new topic directly into the **"Generate from Topic"** text area.
-   **Goal**: To maintain a steady stream of relevant topics in the Content Assistant.

### Phase 2: AI Configuration (The "Brain")

-   **Action**: Before generating new content, review the **AI Content Brain**.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] Is the **Writing Voice & Tone** consistent with our brand guide?
    -   [ ] Is there any new **Specific Guidance** to add (e.g., "Mention our new feature in all blog posts this month")?
    -   [ ] Are the **Recent Work Examples** fresh and representative of our best work?
-   **Importance**: This step ensures brand consistency and quality across all AI-generated drafts.

### Phase 3: Content Generation & Drafting

-   **Action**: The content creator selects an idea from the list or types a new one.
-   **Procedure**:
    1.  Click **"Generate Content"**.
    2.  The AI will produce drafts for multiple formats (Blog, Social Media, etc.). These will appear in the **"Generated Content"** section.
    3.  The initial status of all drafts is **"Draft"**.

### Phase 4: Review and Refinement

-   **Action**: The content creator or editor reviews the generated drafts.
-   **Procedure**:
    1.  Click the **"Edit"** button on a content card to make manual adjustments.
    2.  Once a draft is ready for storage and collaboration, click **"Send to Drive"**. The status changes to **"In Drive"**.
    3.  The content is now available as a document in the shared Google Drive for team review.

### Phase 5: Approval and Scheduling

-   **Action**: After final review and approval from stakeholders (done outside the app, in Google Drive), the content is finalized.
-   **Procedure**:
    1.  The content strategist returns to the Content Workspace.
    2.  Find the relevant content card (which should have the status "In Drive").
    3.  Click **"Approve"**.
-   **Result**:
    -   The status changes to **"Approved"**.
    -   The content is automatically **synced to Airtable**, which can trigger a downstream automation for scheduling and publishing.
    -   The content piece is now considered finalized and ready for the final stages of the publishing pipeline.
