# SOP: Client Onboarding Process

**Objective:** To standardize and automate the client onboarding process, ensuring consistency, speed, and a positive first impression.

**Primary Tool:** Maxwell Vantage - Projects Assistant

---

### Step 1: Project Creation in Primary Data Source

-   **Action**: When a new deal is closed, a project manager creates a new project record in the company's Airtable base.
-   **Critical Field**: The `Status` field for the new project **must** be set to **"Onboarding"**.
-   **Result**: This action triggers the project's appearance in the Maxwell Vantage "Onboarding Assistant Queue".

### Step 2: Review and Configure the Onboarding Playbook

-   **Action**: Before initiating the first onboarding of the day, navigate to the **Projects Assistant** and review the **Onboarding Playbook**.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] Are the Document Templates up-to-date with our latest standards?
    -   [ ] Does the Welcome Email Template reflect our current messaging and tone?
-   **Note**: Use the "Suggest with AI" or "Draft with AI" features if templates need refreshing. This step ensures all subsequent onboardings use the correct assets.

### Step 3: Initiate and Execute Onboarding

-   **Action**: In the **Onboarding Assistant Queue**, identify the new client project and click **"Initiate Onboarding"**.
-   **Procedure**:
    1.  The system will generate an "Onboarding Plan" for review.
    2.  Carefully check the auto-filled client name in the document titles and email.
    3.  Read through the welcome email body. Make any necessary minor edits for personalization (e.g., referencing a specific conversation).
    4.  Click **"Confirm & Execute"**.
-   **Result**: The project status is automatically updated to "On Track", and all initial client-facing communications and documents are handled.

### Step 4: Post-Onboarding Verification

-   **Action**: The project manager verifies the successful execution of the onboarding.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] Check the "Recent Activity" feed on the Dashboard for a confirmation message.
    -   [ ] Briefly check the project's shared Google Drive folder to ensure the documents were created correctly.
    -   [ ] The project should no longer appear in the Onboarding Queue.
-   **Follow-up**: The project manager can now proceed with scheduling the kick-off call mentioned in the automated welcome email.
