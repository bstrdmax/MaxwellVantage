### Step 1: Calibrate the System Context

-   **Action**: At the beginning of each week, or whenever a strategic shift occurs, the Head of Sales reviews and updates the **System Context**.
-   **Importance**: This is the most critical step. The quality of the AI's output is directly proportional to the quality of this input.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] Does the "Ideal Client Persona" reflect our current target market?
    -   [ ] Is the "Sales Strategy" up-to-date with our latest outreach methods?

### Step 2: Generate New Leads

-   **Action**: A sales development representative (SDR) navigates to the **AI Prospector**.
-   **Procedure**:
    1.  Formulate a specific query describing the desired prospect segment (e.g., "e-commerce companies using Shopify Plus that recently hired a CMO").
    2.  *Alternatively*, click **"Get Suggestion"** to have the AI propose a search query based on the System Context.
    3.  Click **"Find New Prospects"**. The AI will generate a list of new potential leads.

### Step 3: Qualify and Analyze Leads

-   **Action**: The SDR reviews the newly generated prospects in the **Prospect List**.
-   **Procedure**:
    1.  Select a high-lead-score prospect from the list.
    2.  If an analysis does not exist, click **"Generate AI Analysis"**.
    3.  Review the generated analysis:
        -   Does the **Company Analysis** confirm a potential need?
        -   Is the **Conversion Strategy** sound?
        -   Are the **Key Talking Points** relevant and personalized?
    4.  Based on this analysis, the SDR decides if the prospect is qualified.

### Step 4: Outreach and System Update

-   **Action**: For qualified prospects, the SDR begins the outreach process.
-   **Procedure**:
    1.  Use the AI-generated **Key Talking Points** to draft a personalized email or LinkedIn message.
    2.  After the initial outreach is made, click **"Sync to Airtable"**.
-   **Result**: The prospect is now considered a qualified lead and is moved into the official CRM / sales pipeline in Airtable for further tracking. The sales cycle continues from there.
